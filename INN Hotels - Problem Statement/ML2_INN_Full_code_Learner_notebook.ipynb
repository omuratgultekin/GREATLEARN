    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Many hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost, which benefits hotel guests. Still, it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers\u2019 booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The cancellation of bookings impacts a hotel on various fronts:\n",
    "1. Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.\n",
    "2. Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.\n",
    "3. Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.\n",
    "4. Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal, they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **Pricing**: Aviation and Online segments have the highest average room prices, while Complementary bookings are (as expected) near zero.\n",
    "4. **Cancellation Rate**: Approximately 32.7% of all bookings are canceled.\n",
    "5. **Special Requests**: Bookings with more special requests are significantly less likely to cancel. 100% of bookings with 3 or more requests were completed.\n",
    "6. **Repeated Guests**: Loyalty is a strong predictor; only ~1.7% of repeated guests cancel their stay."

    "\n",
    "1. **What are the busiest months in the hotel?**\n",
    "   - October is the busiest month with 5,317 bookings, followed by September (4,611) and August (3,813).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which market segment do most of the guests come from?**\n",
    "   - The majority of guests come from the **Online** segment (64%), followed by Offline (29%).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the differences in room prices in different market segments?**\n",
    "   - Online and Aviation segments have the highest average prices (~112\u20ac and ~100\u20ac respectively). Corporate and Offline are mid-range (~83-91\u20ac), while Complementary is near zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What percentage of bookings are canceled?**\n",
    "   - approximately **32.8%** of the bookings in the dataset are canceled.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What percentage of repeating guests cancel?**\n",
    "   - Only about **1.7%** of repeating guests cancel, compared to 33.6% for new guests. Repeating guests are highly reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Do special requirements affect booking cancellation?**\n",
    "   - Yes, significantly. As the number of special requests increases, the cancellation rate drops. Bookings with 3 or more requests have a 0% cancellation rate."
