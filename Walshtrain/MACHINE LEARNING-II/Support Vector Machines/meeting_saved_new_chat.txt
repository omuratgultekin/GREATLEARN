	thats ok
	
2026-01-11 12:39:06 From Dessie Ramnath . to Everyone:
	all good
	
2026-01-11 13:04:36 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	Scaling is performed before train–test split.
	
2026-01-11 13:13:28 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	Model Utility
	We have been able to build a predictive model that can be used by the government to find the citizens having less than 50K salary with an f1_score of 0.9 on the training set and formulate policies accordingly.
	Explanation
	High F1-score ensures:
	balanced identification,
	reduced misallocation of benefits,
	minimized opportunity loss.
	
	2) Model Robustness
	All the SVM models have given a generalized performance on the training and test sets, and there is very little difference between their performances.
	Explanation
	Indicates:
	reliable preprocessing,
	stable feature representation,
	absence of severe overfitting.
	
	3) Education-Focused Policy
	The government should promote education among citizens...
	Explanation
	Directly supported by:
	salary vs education analysis,
	strong separation in income across education levels.
	This is evidence-backed, not speculative.
	
2026-01-11 13:13:36 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	4) Working Hours & Labor Policy
	Working hours is one of the significant predictors of salary...
	Explanation
	Supported by:
	bivariate analysis,
	wider working-hour spread for higher-income groups.
	Aligns with:
	fair pay,
	work–life balance objectives.
	
	5) Private Sector & Pay Equity
	Reforms should be made for private-sector employees...
	Policy formulated by the government should be considerate of equal pay...
	Explanation
	Directly grounded in:
	salary vs workclass,
	salary vs sex analysis.
	These recommendations are descriptive-policy aligned, not causal claims.
	
2026-01-11 13:16:32 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
	It works by finding a decision boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes with the maximum margin.
	The data points closest to the boundary are called support vectors.
	Only support vectors influence the model; other points do not affect the boundary.
	SVM focuses on generalization, not just fitting training data.
	It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and works well with limited data.
	SVM is robust to overfitting, especially when the margin is large.
	
2026-01-11 13:17:08 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	Linear Kernel
	Used when data is linearly separable
	Simple, fast, and interpretable
	Polynomial Kernel
	Captures feature interactions
	Higher degree → more complex decision boundary
	Risk of overfitting if degree is too high
	RBF (Gaussian) Kernel
	Handles non-linear data well
	Flexible but sensitive to hyperparameters
	
2026-01-11 13:17:45 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	C (Regularization parameter)
	Controls trade-off between margin size and misclassification
	High C → low bias, high variance
	Low C → high bias, low variance
	Gamma
	Controls influence of individual data points
	High gamma → complex boundary (risk of overfitting)
	Low gamma → smoother boundary
	
2026-01-11 13:18:31 From Faculty (Olympus) to Everyone:
	Support Vector Machine is a margin-based classifier that uses support vectors and kernel functions to create optimal decision boundaries, focusing on generalization rather than fitting all data points.

	thanks all, and happy new year
